// What is the difference between var and let?
// A: Js 'var' is a legacy declaration that allow us to
// initialize variables. var can changed its value at any
// point and can also be redeclared. 'let'was part of a 
// series of updates done to js in its ES2015 version. let 
// just like var, allow us to initilize varibales - its 
// value can change but it can't be redeclared. it is blocked
// scoped as well, unlive var. 

// What is the difference between var and const?
// A: Js 'var' is a legacy declaration that allow us to
// initialize variables. var can changed its value at any
// point and can also be redeclared. 'const'was part of a 
// series of updates done to js in its ES2015 version. const 
// just like var, allow us to initilize varibales - its 
// value can't change and it can't be redeclared. it is blocked

// What is the difference between let and const?
// 'let' and 'const' work very similar but const is more strict
// as its inilized valu can't be changed. let does allow it.

// What is hoisting?
