    <h1>How Web Works Exercise</h1>
    <h2>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h2>
    <p>In your own terms, define the following terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is HTTP?</li>
      <li>What is a URL?</li>
      <li>What is DNS?</li>
      <li>What is a query string?</li>
      <li>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</li>
      <li>What is an HTTP request?</li>
      <li>What is an HTTP response?</li>
      <li>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</li>
      <li>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part Two: Practice Tools</h2>
    <p>Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”</p>
    <p>Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com</p>
    <p>Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.</p>  
    <h2>Part Three: Explore Dev Tools</h2>
    <p>Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.</p>
    <p>Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.</p>
    <p>Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.</p>
